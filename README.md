# Hi, I'm Robert!

I'm a software engineering student who enjoys building practical, well-structured applications.  
Most of my work focuses on web development and programming projects that let me learn new concepts and improve my skills.

## About Me

I'm curious about how software systems work and enjoy turning ideas into real, working solutions.  
I like writing clean, maintainable code and experimenting with different approaches to solving problems.  
Recently, I've been focusing on learning **Laravel**, **React**, and improving my understanding of **algorithms** and **system design**.  
Outside of coding, I enjoy understanding how things fit together â€” from databases to frontends â€”  
and learning about best practices that make software easier to build and maintain.
